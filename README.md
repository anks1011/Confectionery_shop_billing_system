By: Ankit Singh and Atifa Naaz
 
Introduction
The Confectionary Shop Billing System is a simple PHP/MySQLi project that can help certain shops to manage their customer's bills and receipts. This system stores the list of menus or products that the shop serves with their price and the product list are organized by category. The Shop will take the orders of their customer then the cashier or the order encoder can choose customers who will pay as they order. To track the order of the customers the shop will provide a bill number per order same as the common process of some shops, fast food, restaurants, or cafes. The Confectionary Shop Billing System generates also a monthly sales report. The system has a simple calculator for payout transactions which means the user will only input the amount tendered of the customer then the system will calculate the change of the customer.
